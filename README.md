![Build & Tests](https://github.com/CorruptComputer/Questy/workflows/build-and-tests/badge.svg)

This project was forked from https://github.com/LuckyPennySoftware/MediatR at commit 3f5c3eca8db07e3791f638243bbb879ef847c09e, which is from before their license change. I will be keeping the same license as was there in this commit and have no plans to change that. This fork was made for my own personal use and there will be changes as I see fit, so this is probably not something you want to use.
